# arturitc
Autonomous Robot for Tank for Usage in Reinforced, Incentive-driven Training of my Cats

## note
The name of this project is a tribute to the StarsWars robot R2D2: we, Chileans, are awful English speakers so we pronounce R2D2 "Are Two Dee Too", which is very similiar to "Arturito", which is can be translated (more or less) as "Little Arturo" (Arturo is a name). Because of this slang-ish aberration, in Chile we call every robot "Arturito". 

## purpose
To develop and deploy a system to make by bloody cats eat separately their own God damn food. For that the system needs to

- Know when the cats are in different rooms 
- Be able to autonomously close/open the door between rooms
- Trigger food dispensers appropiately

So yeah, I needed a repo for this because the project quickly became complex.
